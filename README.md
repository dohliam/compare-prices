# Compare prices - Shopping helper

Let's say you are looking at two different products in a store. The first one is $5.89 for 350 __ml__, and the second one is $7.50 for 16 __fl oz__. Quick, which one is the better deal? "Compare prices" can help you quickly and easily resolve this problem.

## Usage

Enter the cost of the items in the __price__ field. This will work for any currency counted in units of 100 (dollars, euros, rubles, etc).

Enter the dry or liquid weight of the items in the __per__ field, and select the type of units from the dropdown menu below.

Press the __Convert__ button to calculate the result. The prices will be standardized to the cost per 100 g if dry weight, or 100 ml if fluid weight.
